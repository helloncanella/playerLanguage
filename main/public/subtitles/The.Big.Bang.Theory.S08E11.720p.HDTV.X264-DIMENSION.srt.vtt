00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:04.874
Hey, how are things going
with your parents?

2
00:00:04.875 --> 00:00:07.676
Not great.
They hired divorce attorneys.

3
00:00:07.678 --> 00:00:09.378
You know, speaking
of attorneys,

4
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.647
if I ever needed
a lawyer,

5
00:00:11.649 --> 00:00:14.950
I would not hire
She-Hulk.

6
00:00:15.853 --> 00:00:17.786
You know what?
That was almost on topic.

7
00:00:17.788 --> 00:00:20.289
I'm gonna say,
"Good job, Sheldon."

8
00:00:21.192 --> 00:00:23.292
Wait, She-Hulk's
a lawyer?

9
00:00:23.294 --> 00:00:25.127
Yeah, she works at
a law firm in New York.

10
00:00:25.129 --> 00:00:28.397
Yes, but she's the only
monster at the firm.

11
00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:30.299
Between you, me
and the wall,

12
00:00:30.301 --> 00:00:33.736
I think she's an
affirmative action hire.

13
00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:36.939
Anyway, Dad's gonna
be here in town,

14
00:00:36.941 --> 00:00:39.475
so I won't be able to do
Christmas dinner this year.

15
00:00:39.477 --> 00:00:41.477
If you're not up
to hosting Christmas dinner,

16
00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:42.711
I'm happy to do it.

17
00:00:42.713 --> 00:00:44.279
You can even
bring your father.

18
00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:46.048
That would be nice.

19
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.182
I've always wanted to do

20
00:00:47.184 --> 00:00:48.817
a traditional
Victorian Christmas.

21
00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:51.820
Parlor games,
goose and figgy pudding...

22
00:00:51.822 --> 00:00:54.490
Ugh!

23
00:00:54.492 --> 00:00:56.024
English pudding.

24
00:00:56.026 --> 00:00:57.793
Y-You get yourself all
excited for pudding,

25
00:00:57.795 --> 00:01:00.829
and here comes a cake
with raisins in it.

26
00:01:00.831 --> 00:01:02.598
I'm not going.

27
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.766
You're going.

28
00:01:03.768 --> 00:01:05.934
Why do you hate me?

29
00:01:05.936 --> 00:01:07.469
I don't hate you.

30
00:01:07.471 --> 00:01:08.437
I love you.

31
00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:09.671
Well, you call it love,

32
00:01:09.673 --> 00:01:11.707
but it has a lot
of raisins in it.

33
00:01:14.145 --> 00:01:15.911
Amy, good luck getting
these guys excited

34
00:01:15.913 --> 00:01:17.312
about a dinner
with a theme.

35
00:01:17.314 --> 00:01:20.949
I gave up when no one cared
about my Tom Hanks-giving.

36
00:01:22.153 --> 00:01:25.154
I think a Victorian Christmas
sounds nice.

37
00:01:25.156 --> 00:01:25.888
I agree.
Why not?

38
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:26.955
Me, too.

39
00:01:26.957 --> 00:01:29.057
You guys suck!

40
00:01:29.059 --> 00:01:32.661
âª Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state âª

41
00:01:32.663 --> 00:01:35.998
âª Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! âª

42
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.633
âª The Earth began to cool âª

43
00:01:37.635 --> 00:01:40.169
âª The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools âª

44
00:01:40.171 --> 00:01:42.838
âª We built the Wall âª
âª<i> We built the pyramids</i> âª

45
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.507
âª Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery âª

46
00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.442
âª That all started
with a big bang âª

00:01:47.444 --> 00:01:49.376

50
00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:03.004
You know the best part
of working in the clean room?

51
00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:04.039
No allergies.

52
00:02:04.041 --> 00:02:05.340
Check it out.

53
00:02:07.344 --> 00:02:09.511
Oh, that-that...
that's a lot of oxygen.

54
00:02:11.515 --> 00:02:13.815
We should get
going to Amy's.

55
00:02:13.817 --> 00:02:15.517
Can you believe
there was a time

56
00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.319
when we would have
needed an array

57
00:02:17.321 --> 00:02:20.088
of giant Cherenkov telescopes
to detect cosmic particles?

58
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.224
And here we are building
our own multi-wire detector

59
00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:26.194
like a couple of badasses.

60
00:02:26.196 --> 00:02:28.196
I know. If we were still single,

61
00:02:28.198 --> 00:02:31.466
we'd be tripping
over all that booty.

62
00:02:31.468 --> 00:02:35.503
Ladies do love a man dressed
like a kitchen garbage bag.

63
00:02:40.577 --> 00:02:43.411
Oh, no.

64
00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:46.314
How the hell
did a pigeon get in here?

65
00:02:46.316 --> 00:02:48.350
You shut the loading doors, right?
I thought you did.

66
00:02:48.352 --> 00:02:50.518
Do you know what a
disaster this is?!

67
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.021
You mean 'cause this room isn't
supposed to have dust in it,

68
00:02:53.023 --> 00:02:55.991
and we just let in
a flying crap machine?!

69
00:02:55.993 --> 00:02:58.827
What do we do?
Should we call someone?

70
00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.696
And tell them that we
compromised all the equipment?

71
00:03:01.698 --> 00:03:04.065
Let's just get it out of
here before anyone knows.

72
00:03:04.067 --> 00:03:05.367
Okay, how do we catch it?

73
00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:07.769
Well, what if we turn
off all the lights

74
00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:10.038
except for one, and
it'll come to it.

75
00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.907
It's not a moth!

76
00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:15.276
Don't yell at me.

77
00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:17.612
You're not gonna get
any good ideas out of me

78
00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:18.680
if you're yelling.

79
00:03:18.682 --> 00:03:20.248
Okay, so if I remain calm,

80
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.218
I'll get more gems like,
"Turn off the lights"?!

81
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.786
Great, we're turning
on each other.

82
00:03:24.788 --> 00:03:27.055
That's just what the
bird wants us to do!

83
00:03:29.326 --> 00:03:32.527
So, Dr. Koothrappali,
long flight?

84
00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:34.963
20 hours.
Oh, that's rough.

85
00:03:34.965 --> 00:03:38.066
Not at all. Did you know that
when you fly transcontinental

86
00:03:38.068 --> 00:03:41.436
without your wife, you don't
pray for the plane to crash?

87
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.107
Can you please talk
about anything else?

88
00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.376
Forgive me.

89
00:03:48.378 --> 00:03:49.577
How are you
and Leonard?

90
00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.479
Oh, great.
Everything's good.

91
00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:54.015
I see you got engaged.
Yes, we did.

92
00:03:54.017 --> 00:03:55.083
Let me tell you a story.

93
00:03:55.085 --> 00:03:56.618
Dad!

94
00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.653
Sorry.

95
00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:01.156
I'm sure you won't grow
to hate each other.

96
00:04:04.861 --> 00:04:07.362
Hey, Leonard. What's up?

97
00:04:07.364 --> 00:04:10.432
What? How did that happen?

98
00:04:10.434 --> 00:04:11.466
Yeah, okay.

99
00:04:11.468 --> 00:04:13.268
I'll be there as soon as I can.

100
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.470
Sorry. I have to run
to the university.

101
00:04:15.472 --> 00:04:16.571
What's going on?

102
00:04:16.573 --> 00:04:19.374
There's been a problem
with our experiment.

103
00:04:19.376 --> 00:04:21.443
A bird got into the clean room.

104
00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:23.945
You want me to come?
Uh, no.

105
00:04:23.947 --> 00:04:26.214
You had a long flight.
You stay here and relax.

106
00:04:26.216 --> 00:04:28.716
"Relax."
Easy for you to say.

107
00:04:28.718 --> 00:04:31.052
Your mother isn't cleaning out
your bank account.

108
00:04:31.054 --> 00:04:35.490
40 years,
the woman never cleaned a thing.

109
00:04:35.492 --> 00:04:37.258
You're just
gonna leave him here?

110
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.494
"Relax," he says.
Yup. Bye.

111
00:04:41.898 --> 00:04:44.933
âª Here comes Santa Claus,
here comes Santa Claus âª

112
00:04:44.935 --> 00:04:46.501
âª Right down Santa Claus Lane âª

113
00:04:46.503 --> 00:04:49.104
âª Vixen and Blitzen
and all his reindeer âª

114
00:04:49.106 --> 00:04:50.839
âª Pulling on
the reins... âª

115
00:04:50.841 --> 00:04:52.006
Yeah, I appreciate the ride...

116
00:04:52.008 --> 00:04:54.109
âª Bells are ringing,
children singing âª

117
00:04:54.111 --> 00:04:56.878
âª All is merry
and bright âª

118
00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.247
âª So hang your stockings
and say your prayers âª

119
00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:02.484
âª 'Cause Santa Claus
is coming tonight... âª

120
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.819
Why'd you turn it off?

121
00:05:04.821 --> 00:05:07.856
Because in the last ten minutes,
Santa came to town,

122
00:05:07.858 --> 00:05:11.860
kissed Mommy and ran Grandma
over with a reindeer.

123
00:05:11.862 --> 00:05:13.995
I had a drunk uncle
who did all those things.

124
00:05:13.997 --> 00:05:16.264
Nobody sings songs about him.

125
00:05:16.266 --> 00:05:19.734
Maybe you'd like it more if you
thought of Santa as a superhero

126
00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:22.403
and his power is bringing joy
to children.

127
00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:25.173
My uncle was accused
of that, too.

128
00:05:25.175 --> 00:05:28.209
It turned out
to be legal in Oklahoma.

129
00:05:28.211 --> 00:05:30.178
Okay, new subject.

130
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.080
Let's talk
about presents.

131
00:05:32.082 --> 00:05:33.748
What did you get Amy?

132
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.283
Oh, we're not exchanging gifts.

133
00:05:35.285 --> 00:05:38.486
Come on, Sheldon, you
have to get her something.

134
00:05:38.488 --> 00:05:39.988
Why should I?

135
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.923
She knows
that I don't like Christmas,

136
00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:44.859
and yet, every year,
she forces me to celebrate it.

137
00:05:44.861 --> 00:05:47.896
Not only am I going to this
foolish dinner against my will.

138
00:05:47.898 --> 00:05:50.298
At the Christmas tree lot,
there was mistletoe,

139
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.433
and she kissed me
under it in public.

140
00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:55.703
Like we were the stars
of a Tijuana sex show.

141
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.641
She's just excited
about the holidays.

142
00:05:59.643 --> 00:06:03.711
Yes, and she's not taking
my feelings into account at all.

143
00:06:03.713 --> 00:06:05.914
Maybe it's time
I teach her a lesson.

144
00:06:05.916 --> 00:06:07.715
How?

145
00:06:07.717 --> 00:06:11.719
Hmm. It'd have
to be something heinous,

146
00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:14.923
something that makes her
as miserable as she's making me.

147
00:06:14.925 --> 00:06:17.325
Oh, I've got it.

148
00:06:18.728 --> 00:06:21.596
This is good.

149
00:06:21.598 --> 00:06:22.764
What?

150
00:06:22.766 --> 00:06:25.900
I'm going to buy her a present.

151
00:06:25.902 --> 00:06:29.971
Yeah, you're gonna
have to walk me through that.

152
00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:32.173
With gift-giving, there's
an implied social contract.

153
00:06:32.175 --> 00:06:33.508
If I show up

154
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.344
tonight with a present,
and she doesn't have one for me,

155
00:06:36.346 --> 00:06:38.980
she'll feel terrible.

156
00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:41.282
Then you're both sad?

157
00:06:41.284 --> 00:06:43.518
Yes.

158
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.886
Maybe she'll feel so guilty,

159
00:06:44.888 --> 00:06:47.055
she'll never make me celebrate
the holidays again.

160
00:06:47.057 --> 00:06:51.993
So your evil plot here is to buy
your girlfriend a present?

161
00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:53.528
That's right.

162
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.598
So stay on my good side, or I'll
get you a little something, too.

163
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.672
Okay, here's the plan.

164
00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:06.874
I'm gonna put the food
in the bag,

165
00:07:06.876 --> 00:07:10.078
and when he lands in the bag
to eat it, we close it up.

166
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.280
A Slim Jim?

167
00:07:12.282 --> 00:07:14.282
It's all I could find.
It'll work.

168
00:07:14.284 --> 00:07:15.416
Sure.

169
00:07:15.418 --> 00:07:17.252
If the pigeon's stoned
or a trucker.

170
00:07:19.956 --> 00:07:21.289
Okay, well, what's your plan?

171
00:07:21.291 --> 00:07:22.490
I told you my plan.

172
00:07:22.492 --> 00:07:24.158
Let's call Building Services
and get help.

173
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.528
And admit that we contaminated
the clean room?

174
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.064
No, admit that<i> you</i>
contaminated the clean room.

175
00:07:30.066 --> 00:07:32.233
Why do you keep assuming
it was me?

176
00:07:32.235 --> 00:07:34.469
Because you do this kind
of thing all the time,

177
00:07:34.471 --> 00:07:36.371
and then you try
to cover it up.

178
00:07:36.373 --> 00:07:38.373
Like when?

179
00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:40.808
What about when you
flipped the Mars Rover,

180
00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.477
or lost Koothrappali's dog,

181
00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:45.013
or almost drove off
with that baby?

182
00:07:45.015 --> 00:07:48.716
Again, it looked like my car,
and the baby didn't even cry

183
00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:50.885
until his mother punched me
with her keys.

184
00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:53.521
Fine, put the Slim Jim
in the garbage bag.

185
00:07:53.523 --> 00:07:55.490
Well, what if you said it

186
00:07:55.492 --> 00:07:56.824
without sounding
so condescending?

187
00:07:56.826 --> 00:07:59.093
I can try, but your
plan has the words

188
00:07:59.095 --> 00:08:01.162
"garbage bag" and
"Slim Jim" in it!

189
00:08:01.164 --> 00:08:03.364
Hey, what's going on?
Oh.

190
00:08:03.366 --> 00:08:04.899
Genius here wants
to catch a bird

191
00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:06.934
with a garbage bag
and a Slim Jim.

192
00:08:11.274 --> 00:08:14.909
Should have put it
in the bag first.

193
00:08:23.836 --> 00:08:25.604
So, if you don't
mind me asking,

194
00:08:25.605 --> 00:08:27.638
do you think you might
start dating again?

195
00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.106
It's much too soon for that.

196
00:08:29.108 --> 00:08:31.108
Why? Do you know someone?

197
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:34.178
No, but if things don't
work out with me and Leonard,

198
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.780
I'll give you a call.

199
00:08:35.782 --> 00:08:38.916
Wait. How much do you talk
about<i> Star Trek?</i>

200
00:08:40.553 --> 00:08:44.155
Okay, let's get this
Victorian party started.

201
00:08:44.157 --> 00:08:45.489
I've done some research

202
00:08:45.491 --> 00:08:47.758
about some traditional
parlor games we can play.

203
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:48.993
Like what?

204
00:08:48.995 --> 00:08:53.464
Well, there's a fun one
called Ball of Wool.

205
00:08:54.634 --> 00:08:56.667
You take a ball of wool,

206
00:08:56.669 --> 00:08:59.170
and you put it right
in the center of the table.

207
00:08:59.172 --> 00:09:00.338
Then people sit

208
00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:01.672
on opposite sides of the table

209
00:09:01.674 --> 00:09:03.874
and try to blow the wool off.

210
00:09:06.446 --> 00:09:09.347
Sorry.
She's taken, too.

211
00:09:11.751 --> 00:09:13.584
You know what I think
your problem is?

212
00:09:13.586 --> 00:09:14.452
You're jealous

213
00:09:14.454 --> 00:09:16.053
because you and I
used to be

214
00:09:16.055 --> 00:09:18.789
best friends until
Koothrappali came along.

215
00:09:18.791 --> 00:09:21.292
And you found somebody
you could push around?

216
00:09:21.294 --> 00:09:22.593
Hey!
Stay out of this.

217
00:09:22.595 --> 00:09:25.129
Okay.

218
00:09:25.131 --> 00:09:27.264
You know, maybe I'm
best friends with Raj

219
00:09:27.266 --> 00:09:29.200
because he doesn't think
he's smarter than me.

220
00:09:29.202 --> 00:09:31.802
Actually...
I said, stay out of it!

221
00:09:31.804 --> 00:09:34.639
N-No. No, Raj, go ahead,
say what you were gonna say.

222
00:09:34.641 --> 00:09:35.840
All I'm gonna say is

223
00:09:35.842 --> 00:09:37.875
you guys need
to stop this right now.

224
00:09:37.877 --> 00:09:40.311
It-It's bad enough that
my parents are fighting,

225
00:09:40.313 --> 00:09:42.613
now I have to hear
the two of you?

226
00:09:42.615 --> 00:09:43.714
And who cares who's smarter?

227
00:09:43.716 --> 00:09:45.282
If it's Leonard or me or...

228
00:09:45.284 --> 00:09:47.918
you know, it's Christmas,
let's say it's Howard.

229
00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:53.858
Well, if you're so smart,
you get the bird out.

230
00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.092
No, you're the one
who let him in.

231
00:09:55.094 --> 00:09:57.128
How do you know
it wasn't Leonard?

232
00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:59.096
Come on.

233
00:10:02.802 --> 00:10:04.669
What about that sweater?

234
00:10:04.671 --> 00:10:06.137
No, it's not good enough.

235
00:10:06.139 --> 00:10:08.439
It has to be perfect.

236
00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:10.408
I think the nicest gifts
I've got from Howie

237
00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:12.143
show how well
he knows me.

238
00:10:12.145 --> 00:10:13.244
Hmm.

239
00:10:13.246 --> 00:10:15.980
Let's see,
what do I know about Amy?

240
00:10:15.982 --> 00:10:19.917
She loves medieval literature;
Chaucer's her favorite.

241
00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:23.754
And her eyes sparkle when
she watches old French movies.

242
00:10:23.756 --> 00:10:28.159
I enjoy how harp music causes
her fingers to dance

243
00:10:28.161 --> 00:10:30.261
as if she's playing along.

244
00:10:30.263 --> 00:10:33.264
Wow, you really do love her.

245
00:10:34.267 --> 00:10:35.933
I do.

246
00:10:36.936 --> 00:10:38.903
Now, let's find
the kind of gift

247
00:10:38.905 --> 00:10:42.206
that makes her feel
small and worthless.

248
00:11:11.137 --> 00:11:12.570
You won!

249
00:11:14.807 --> 00:11:17.842
Certainly doesn't
feel like it, does it?

250
00:11:18.711 --> 00:11:20.411
You know, my wife used to throw

251
00:11:20.413 --> 00:11:22.646
theme parties like this
all the time.

252
00:11:22.648 --> 00:11:24.982
Oh, I guess that's
where Raj gets it from.

253
00:11:24.984 --> 00:11:27.651
Well, he and his mother
spent a lot of time together

254
00:11:27.653 --> 00:11:28.986
when he was young.

255
00:11:28.988 --> 00:11:30.154
I was always working.

256
00:11:30.156 --> 00:11:32.690
Hey, you know, Raj is dating

257
00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:34.759
a doctor who works a lot.

258
00:11:34.761 --> 00:11:37.061
Him and his mom have a type.

259
00:11:37.063 --> 00:11:40.331
You g... Y-You got to laugh
at that, right?

260
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.200
No? All right.

261
00:11:46.072 --> 00:11:48.706
All right, let me see
if I've got this straight.

262
00:11:49.742 --> 00:11:51.742
A picture of you on my lap

263
00:11:51.744 --> 00:11:53.811
is a way to punish
your girlfriend

264
00:11:53.813 --> 00:11:55.813
for making you
celebrate Christmas?

265
00:11:55.815 --> 00:11:57.381
Correct.

266
00:11:57.383 --> 00:12:01.252
Santa thinks dating you
may be punishment enough.

267
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:06.290
There's an argument
for that.

268
00:12:06.292 --> 00:12:08.192
But I want to make sure.

269
00:12:08.194 --> 00:12:09.026
Smile.

270
00:12:09.028 --> 00:12:10.861
Ho, ho, ho!

271
00:12:16.369 --> 00:12:19.036
Okay. On the
count of three,

272
00:12:19.038 --> 00:12:21.238
I'll shoot the fire extinguisher
and get him airborne.

273
00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.774
Howard, you wave the blanket
and guide him towards the exit.

274
00:12:23.776 --> 00:12:25.876
Raj, you hold open the
curtain so he can fly out.

275
00:12:25.878 --> 00:12:28.345
Are you sure a dummy
like me can handle something

276
00:12:28.347 --> 00:12:30.481
as complicated
as a blanket?

277
00:12:30.483 --> 00:12:32.650
Do you want the
fire extinguisher?

278
00:12:32.652 --> 00:12:34.218
Yeah, I do.
Great.

279
00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:35.519
Here you go.

280
00:12:35.521 --> 00:12:37.721
Okay.

281
00:12:39.826 --> 00:12:42.393
One, two, three.

282
00:12:45.898 --> 00:12:47.765
Uh, you have to
take the pin out.

283
00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:54.271
You miss the blanket now,
don't you?

284
00:12:56.843 --> 00:12:58.142
On three.

285
00:12:58.144 --> 00:13:00.778
One, two, three.

286
00:13:09.322 --> 00:13:10.855
What did you do?

287
00:13:10.857 --> 00:13:12.823
It was an accident.

288
00:13:12.825 --> 00:13:14.959
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

289
00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:16.861
Relax, it wasn't your fault.

290
00:13:16.863 --> 00:13:18.495
Uh, maybe it's just stunned.

291
00:13:18.497 --> 00:13:20.097
Dude, i-it's not breathing.

292
00:13:20.099 --> 00:13:23.500
Oh, no. I killed it.

293
00:13:23.502 --> 00:13:25.436
Oh, not again.

294
00:13:26.272 --> 00:13:28.372
What do you mean, not again?

295
00:13:30.309 --> 00:13:32.509
When I was ten,

296
00:13:32.511 --> 00:13:36.280
I was playing
in my backyard and...

297
00:13:36.282 --> 00:13:38.716
sat on a blue jay.

298
00:13:40.453 --> 00:13:42.653
I mean, I tried
to bring it back to life

299
00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:45.623
with electricity, but it just...

300
00:13:45.625 --> 00:13:47.491
caught on fire.

301
00:13:50.029 --> 00:13:53.631
The worst part was
it smelled delicious.

302
00:13:55.067 --> 00:13:57.067
Uh, guys, I found
an article here

303
00:13:57.069 --> 00:13:59.236
that says you can do CPR
on birds.

304
00:13:59.238 --> 00:14:00.738
Great! Do it!

305
00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:02.439
I'm not doing it.
You killed him, you do it.

306
00:14:02.441 --> 00:14:04.441
I'll do it.
No.

307
00:14:04.443 --> 00:14:05.309
I need to do it.

308
00:14:05.311 --> 00:14:07.511
This is on me.

309
00:14:11.717 --> 00:14:13.083
Okay.

310
00:14:13.085 --> 00:14:16.153
"Mouth over beak
and light chest compressions."

311
00:14:16.155 --> 00:14:17.321
Don't blow too hard.

312
00:14:17.323 --> 00:14:20.157
If you pop him, I will vomit.

313
00:14:21.661 --> 00:14:23.260
Anything?

314
00:14:23.262 --> 00:14:25.429
I am tasting a lot of Slim Jim.

315
00:14:29.335 --> 00:14:31.769
Wait, wait, his wing moved!

316
00:14:31.771 --> 00:14:33.771
Oh, he blinked his eyes!
He's alive!

317
00:14:33.773 --> 00:14:35.205
It's a Christmas miracle!

318
00:14:35.207 --> 00:14:37.841
I might argue a Hanukkah
miracle, but I'll take it.

319
00:14:37.843 --> 00:14:40.811
Come on, little guy, let's get
you outside. Get the curtain.

320
00:14:48.487 --> 00:14:51.722
Someone should really
close that loading door.

321
00:14:57.897 --> 00:15:00.064
Well, that's that.

322
00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:01.732
The room's compromised.

323
00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:03.567
They'll have to change
all the filters,

324
00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:06.437
probably shut it down
for weeks.

325
00:15:06.439 --> 00:15:09.340
You were right. Go ahead,
call Building Services.

326
00:15:09.342 --> 00:15:11.542
Tell them it was my fault.
No, we're both to blame.

327
00:15:11.544 --> 00:15:13.110
You know, let me take
the heat on this one.

328
00:15:13.112 --> 00:15:14.378
Yeah, just leave me out of it.

329
00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:16.380
You know if they come here
and see crap everywhere,

330
00:15:16.382 --> 00:15:18.749
they're just gonna
blame the Indian guy.

331
00:15:24.056 --> 00:15:25.723
Hey. I'm sorry,
we're still here.

332
00:15:25.725 --> 00:15:27.157
Is everything okay?

333
00:15:27.159 --> 00:15:28.559
It's kind of boring.

334
00:15:28.561 --> 00:15:30.294
Although it did get exciting
for a minute

335
00:15:30.296 --> 00:15:32.763
when Amy inhaled a wool ball.

336
00:15:34.066 --> 00:15:35.232
How much longer
do you think you'll be?

337
00:15:35.234 --> 00:15:36.200
I don't know.

338
00:15:36.202 --> 00:15:37.701
There's still
a bird in here.

339
00:15:37.703 --> 00:15:39.970
We are gonna get in
a ton of trouble.

340
00:15:39.972 --> 00:15:41.872
Honey, it's Christmas Eve.
Who even knows you're in there?

341
00:15:41.874 --> 00:15:43.907
No, our names are on
the sign-in sheet.

342
00:15:43.909 --> 00:15:45.642
So erase them and walk out.

343
00:15:45.644 --> 00:15:47.344
I can't do that.

344
00:15:47.346 --> 00:15:48.479
Can't do what?

345
00:15:48.481 --> 00:15:49.646
She says take our names

346
00:15:49.648 --> 00:15:51.081
off the sign-in sheet
and leave.

347
00:15:51.083 --> 00:15:53.617
We can't do that.
Yeah.

348
00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:59.289
âª Jingle bells, jingle
bells, jingle all the way âª

349
00:15:59.291 --> 00:16:00.991
âª Oh, what fun it is to ride âª

350
00:16:00.993 --> 00:16:03.660
âª In a one-horse
open sleigh, hey! âª

351
00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:06.630
Mmm. Amy,

352
00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:08.499
that pudding was delicious.

353
00:16:08.501 --> 00:16:11.368
If you like raisins.

354
00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:13.670
Thank you. And it's figs.

355
00:16:13.672 --> 00:16:14.672
Oh.

356
00:16:14.673 --> 00:16:16.673
Oh, in that case,
it was pretty good.

357
00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:20.411
You feeling okay? You hardly
touched your goose.

358
00:16:20.413 --> 00:16:23.180
It smelled too much
like blue jay.

359
00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:25.416
Can I help you
clean up?

360
00:16:25.418 --> 00:16:27.951
Oh, you Heimliched a ball
of wool out of me; you're good.

361
00:16:30.322 --> 00:16:32.423
Uh, what do you say
we exchange gifts?

362
00:16:32.425 --> 00:16:33.690
Oh, Sheldon,
we didn't bring any.

363
00:16:33.692 --> 00:16:35.325
I thought you hate
giving gifts.

364
00:16:35.327 --> 00:16:36.327
Yeah, I do.

365
00:16:36.328 --> 00:16:39.696
Which is why I got Amy this.

366
00:16:39.698 --> 00:16:41.165
You got me something?

367
00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:43.267
Oh, not just
something, no.

368
00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:45.669
It's from the heart,
it's holiday-themed,

369
00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:49.840
and I swallowed the gift receipt
so you cannot return it.

370
00:16:53.312 --> 00:16:55.579
Look at you on Santa's lap.

371
00:16:55.581 --> 00:16:57.214
That's so sweet.

372
00:16:57.216 --> 00:17:00.250
Of course it is.
It's the perfect gift.

373
00:17:00.252 --> 00:17:01.819
H-How are you feeling right now?

374
00:17:01.821 --> 00:17:04.288
Guilty? Sad?

375
00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:06.490
Wishing you were Jewish?

376
00:17:07.626 --> 00:17:09.560
No, I love it.

377
00:17:09.562 --> 00:17:10.727
Oh, really?

378
00:17:10.729 --> 00:17:12.229
Well, how about now?

379
00:17:13.966 --> 00:17:17.334
Happy holidays to my dear Amy.

380
00:17:17.336 --> 00:17:20.471
I hope you treasure this

381
00:17:20.473 --> 00:17:24.308
as much as I treasure you.

382
00:17:25.444 --> 00:17:27.544
And you got me nothing.

383
00:17:28.714 --> 00:17:30.447
Christmas is ruined.

384
00:17:30.449 --> 00:17:32.249
Let's never speak of it again.

385
00:17:32.751 --> 00:17:35.052
Well, this was fun.

386
00:17:35.054 --> 00:17:36.753
Actually,

387
00:17:36.755 --> 00:17:39.456
I did get you
something.

388
00:17:39.458 --> 00:17:42.693
But what about our agreement?

389
00:17:42.695 --> 00:17:45.562
Well, you got me
something. Here.

390
00:17:49.602 --> 00:17:51.368
Cookies?

391
00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:53.904
They're your Meemaw's
Christmas cookies.

392
00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:57.007
I called and got
the recipe.

393
00:18:06.318 --> 00:18:08.118
They're perfect.

394
00:18:09.455 --> 00:18:12.456
It tastes like her hugs.

395
00:18:14.393 --> 00:18:16.693
Merry Christmas, Sheldon.

396
00:18:18.063 --> 00:18:20.531
I can't believe this.

397
00:18:20.533 --> 00:18:24.168
You're happy, I'm happy.

398
00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:26.537
Well, maybe a holiday that's
all about giving isn't so...

399
00:18:26.539 --> 00:18:29.072
Get your hand out of that box!

400
00:18:37.881 --> 00:18:39.013
Okay.

401
00:18:39.015 --> 00:18:42.917
The next game is called
Hot Boiled Beans.

402
00:18:44.754 --> 00:18:47.188
Of course it is.

403
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:49.290
One person is sent
out of the room

404
00:18:49.292 --> 00:18:51.759
while the others
hide a small item.

405
00:18:51.761 --> 00:18:53.060
Then they invite

406
00:18:53.062 --> 00:18:54.895
the first person back by saying,

407
00:18:54.897 --> 00:18:57.131
"Hot boiled beans
and bacon for supper,

408
00:18:57.133 --> 00:19:00.634
hurry up before it gets cold."

409
00:19:02.973 --> 00:19:05.507
If you people think this is
better than Tom Hanks-giving,

410
00:19:05.509 --> 00:19:06.775
you're all crazy.
