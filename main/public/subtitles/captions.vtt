ï»¿1
00:00:04.587 --> 00:00:06.754
Okay, we're headed out--
See you later.

2
00:00:06.756 --> 00:00:07.921
Before you leave,

3
00:00:07.923 --> 00:00:10.290
could you test these
noise-cancelling headphones?

4
00:00:10.292 --> 00:00:11.292
Yeah, sure.

5
00:00:11.293 --> 00:00:12.459
Okay.

6
00:00:14.263 --> 00:00:15.263
Go ahead.

7
00:00:15.264 --> 00:00:18.265
Hello, can you
hear me?

8
00:00:21.137 --> 00:00:22.803
Sheldon, I haven't changed
the filter

9
00:00:22.805 --> 00:00:24.905
in the water pitcher
in two years.

10
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.612
Uh, Bernadette's nickname for
you is the virgin piÃ±a colada.

11
00:00:34.483 --> 00:00:38.752
Your George Lucas autograph
is really a âmeâ autograph.

12
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.891
Yeah, well, once I was too lazy
to walk across the hall,

13
00:00:43.893 --> 00:00:45.626
so I used your toothbrush.

14
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.830
Ooh, and one time
when you were asleep,

15
00:00:49.832 --> 00:00:51.498
Amy totally
took off her...

16
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.700
And that's why
you're the best roommate ever.

17
00:00:54.937 --> 00:00:57.271
Aw...

18
00:00:57.273 --> 00:00:58.772
Now I'm sad I didn't hear it.

19
00:00:58.774 --> 00:01:01.241
So what do you need
the headphones for?

20
00:01:01.243 --> 00:01:02.810
Well, I've been
struggling for months

21
00:01:02.812 --> 00:01:05.045
to come up with
a theory of dark matter

22
00:01:05.047 --> 00:01:06.713
that doesn't
make protons decay.

23
00:01:06.715 --> 00:01:08.415
I'm hoping to
finally tackle it

24
00:01:08.417 --> 00:01:10.417
by optimizing my
work environment.

25
00:01:10.419 --> 00:01:15.055
See, I've got, uh, my tea is at
the perfect sipping temperature.

26
00:01:15.057 --> 00:01:17.591
Uh, I have fleece-lined
boxer shorts

27
00:01:17.593 --> 00:01:18.959
to keep my tushie toasty.

28
00:01:18.961 --> 00:01:20.460
And then, oh,
last but not least,

29
00:01:20.462 --> 00:01:23.397
this inspirational cat poster,

30
00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:25.432
improved with
the reassuring face

31
00:01:25.434 --> 00:01:27.668
of physics renegade
Richard Feynman.

32
00:01:30.773 --> 00:01:33.774
Is that why you had to take him
to Office Depot last night?

33
00:01:33.776 --> 00:01:35.976
I don't want to talk about it.

34
00:01:36.812 --> 00:01:38.212
There, the place is all yours.

35
00:01:38.214 --> 00:01:39.179
Yeah, have fun.

36
00:01:39.181 --> 00:01:41.148
Oh, I will--
nothing more fun

37
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.716
than a paradigm-shifting
evening of science.

38
00:01:43.853 --> 00:01:46.153
And you thought it was
soaping me up in the shower.

39
00:01:47.156 --> 00:01:48.121
Bye.

40
00:01:48.123 --> 00:01:50.724
Okay.

41
00:01:50.726 --> 00:01:52.926
Here we go.

42
00:01:54.697 --> 00:01:56.563
Proton decay.

43
00:01:58.033 --> 00:01:59.900
Proton decay.

44
00:02:00.703 --> 00:02:02.569
Proton decay.

45
00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:05.405
Proton decay.

46
00:02:06.542 --> 00:02:08.976
Proton decay.

47
00:02:09.812 --> 00:02:11.144
Proton decay.

48
00:02:11.146 --> 00:02:12.412
Hey, we're home.

49
00:02:14.984 --> 00:02:16.884
Any progress?

50
00:02:16.886 --> 00:02:17.985
How could there be?!

51
00:02:17.987 --> 00:02:19.853
With these constant
interruptions.

52
00:02:21.757 --> 00:02:25.525
I love him, but if he's broken,
let's not get a new one.

53
00:02:26.762 --> 00:02:30.397
âª Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state âª

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:33.734
âª Then nearly 14 billion years

55
00:02:33.736 --> 00:02:35.369
âª The Earth began to cool âª

56

âª The autotrophs began to drool,

57

âª We built the Wall âª
âª<i> We built the pyramids</i> âª

58

unraveling the mystery âª

59
00:02:43.245 --> 00:02:45.145
âª That all started

63
00:02:57.761 --> 00:02:59.060
What are you doing?

64
00:02:59.062 --> 00:03:00.295
It's time to go.

65
00:03:00.297 --> 00:03:02.497
I'm not going to work today.

66
00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:04.432
And would you like
to know why?

67
00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:07.469
Ah, you're upset because you
spent the whole night working

68
00:03:07.471 --> 00:03:09.504
on dark matter
and didn't make a breakthrough,

69
00:03:09.506 --> 00:03:11.439
and now you're worried you made
a huge mistake switching fields,

70
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:13.408
and you're gonna sit around
and sulk all day?

71
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.444
Like a big old baby.

72
00:03:17.915 --> 00:03:19.347
Call me
if you need anything.

73
00:03:22.786 --> 00:03:26.188
I've been cooped up
in here too long.

74
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.191
Maybe I need some fresh air.

75
00:03:47.377 --> 00:03:48.410
Penny?

76
00:03:49.713 --> 00:03:50.745
Penny?

77
00:03:51.682 --> 00:03:53.715
Penny?

78
00:03:55.018 --> 00:03:57.052
Ugh, what?

79
00:03:57.054 --> 00:03:58.920
You sounded in distress.

80
00:03:58.922 --> 00:04:00.622
I was worried something
unpleasant was happening to you.

81
00:04:00.624 --> 00:04:02.157
Like a murder.

82
00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.126
Or spontaneous coitus
with Leonard.

83
00:04:06.897 --> 00:04:08.463
Oh, I'm just doing
this awful workout.

84
00:04:08.465 --> 00:04:09.664
I hate it.

85
00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:12.067
Well, if you hate it,
then why are you doing it?

86
00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:13.868
Although I could ask
the same question

87
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.637
about coitus with Leonard.

88
00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:18.406
I don't know-- I guess
I like that I hate it.

89
00:04:18.408 --> 00:04:20.041
It makes me work harder.

90
00:04:20.043 --> 00:04:21.876
And to clarify...

91
00:04:21.878 --> 00:04:23.745
The exercise, Sheldon.

92
00:04:25.048 --> 00:04:26.982
Shouldn't you be getting
ready for work?

93
00:04:26.984 --> 00:04:28.483
I'm not going.

94
00:04:28.485 --> 00:04:29.884
Would you like to know why?

95
00:04:29.886 --> 00:04:32.520
Uh, you're sad about not getting
anything done last night,

96
00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:34.856
so you're gonna sit around
and pout about it?

97
00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:38.660
Boy, I'm not nearly as
mysterious as I think I am.

98
00:04:40.797 --> 00:04:41.963
I invented a game.

99
00:04:41.965 --> 00:04:43.665
You want to play?
Sure.

100
00:04:43.667 --> 00:04:46.067
It's called
âEmily or Cinnamonâ"

101
00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:49.404
I give you actual quotes
I've heard Raj say,

102
00:04:49.406 --> 00:04:53.642
and you guess if he was talking
to his girlfriend or his dog.

103
00:04:57.581 --> 00:04:59.247
Go ahead, make fun.

104
00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:00.282
You can't embarrass .

105
00:05:00.284 --> 00:05:01.716
I've got a beautiful
girlfriend

106
00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:04.619
and a dog who loves me so much
she drinks my bathwater.

107
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.125
Okay, who was he talking to,
Emily or Cinnamon:

108
00:05:10.127 --> 00:05:12.861
âI want you to know,
the bed feels so lonely

109
00:05:12.863 --> 00:05:14.562
when you're not in it.â

110
00:05:21.004 --> 00:05:23.271
I may not be liking
this game so much.

111
00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:26.308
Cinnamon.
Give me another one.

112
00:05:27.177 --> 00:05:28.677
Okay, Emily or Cinnamon:

113
00:05:28.679 --> 00:05:30.712
âCheck it out,
I got us matching sweaters!â

114
00:05:30.714 --> 00:05:33.248
We all got the Christmas card--
Cinnamon.

115
00:05:34.718 --> 00:05:38.086
You know, a man can care deeply
about a woman and a pet.

116
00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:39.120
It's not strange.

117
00:05:39.122 --> 00:05:40.088
Ooh, Emily.

118
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.290
I heard him say that
to Emily.

119
00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.327
Hey, I thought
you were staying home.

120
00:05:45.329 --> 00:05:47.729
Yeah, I was, but after
talking to Penny,

121
00:05:47.731 --> 00:05:49.331
I realized something.

122
00:05:49.333 --> 00:05:52.701
I... first, she's trying much
harder to stay attractive

123
00:05:52.703 --> 00:05:55.003
in this relationship
than you are.

124
00:05:59.176 --> 00:06:00.642
E'
And second...

125
00:06:00.644 --> 00:06:03.578
the reason I may not be
progressing in my research is

126
00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.248
I've created too pleasant
of an environment for myself.

127
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.583
What do you me?

128
00:06:08.585 --> 00:06:11.086
According to a classic
psychological experiment

129
00:06:11.088 --> 00:06:14.422
by Yerkes and Dodson, in order
to maximize performance,

130
00:06:14.424 --> 00:06:17.559
one must create a state
of productive anxiety.

131
00:06:17.561 --> 00:06:21.262
So I'd like to ask you all
to do something for me.

132
00:06:21.264 --> 00:06:23.098
Keep me on my toes.

133
00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.266
Just throw me off my game.

134
00:06:25.268 --> 00:06:29.371
E-Essentially, go out of your
way to make my life miserable.

135
00:06:31.875 --> 00:06:33.508
Hold on.

136
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.076
What's in it for us?

137
00:06:35.078 --> 00:06:37.178
Well, I suppose...
Okay, we'll do it!

138
00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:47.288
Done.

139
00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:48.923
33 seconds.

140
00:06:48.925 --> 00:06:50.825
Okay, that'll be
our baseline.

141
00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:52.527
You know, I don't
want to tell you

142
00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:55.029
how to do your job, but when
a mouse completes a maze,

143
00:06:55.031 --> 00:06:56.965
it gets a food pellet.

144
00:06:56.967 --> 00:07:00.668
It also gets its brain
plucked out with tweezers.

145
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:03.705
And his last meal was
a food pellet?

146
00:07:03.707 --> 00:07:05.206
You're a monster.

147
00:07:07.344 --> 00:07:09.310
All right, next,
we're gonna introduce

148
00:07:09.312 --> 00:07:11.813
an anxiety-inducing stimulus,
measure your stress levels

149
00:07:11.815 --> 00:07:13.548
and see how it affects
your problem-solving rate.

150
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:14.582
Very well.

151
00:07:14.584 --> 00:07:17.318
And good luck--
I'm a pretty laid-back guy.

152
00:07:19.022 --> 00:07:20.355
Ready?

153
00:07:20.357 --> 00:07:21.890
Begin.

154
00:07:44.281 --> 00:07:45.914
Why'd you pop it?

155
00:07:45.916 --> 00:07:48.183
I'm sorry, I was aiming
for your heart.

156
00:07:51.321 --> 00:07:52.821
Look, I know you
don't like it'

157
00:07:52.823 --> 00:07:54.355
but that's the point
of the experiment.

158
00:07:54.357 --> 00:07:55.924
I need to irritate you

159
00:07:55.926 --> 00:07:58.226
to find your optimal
anxiety zone.

160
00:07:58.228 --> 00:08:00.728
And you said no to
tickling, polka music

161
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.931
or watching me
eat a banana.

162
00:08:02.933 --> 00:08:05.733
Who eats them
horizontally?!

163
00:08:06.937 --> 00:08:09.204
My mother said that's
how good girls do it.

164
00:08:13.376 --> 00:08:15.577
Perhaps this was
a waste of time.

165
00:08:15.579 --> 00:08:17.212
Sheldon,

166
00:08:17.214 --> 00:08:19.147
you're a remarkable scientist.

167
00:08:19.149 --> 00:08:21.583
Just be patient-- I'm sure
you'll find the breakthrough

168
00:08:21.585 --> 00:08:22.917
you've been looking for.

169
00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:24.419
Thank you.

170
00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:26.054
And if you only
do solid research

171
00:08:26.056 --> 00:08:29.123
instead of making
a groundbreaking discovery,

172
00:08:29.125 --> 00:08:30.625
what does it matter?

173
00:08:30.627 --> 00:08:32.994
âOnly do solid researchâ?!

174
00:08:32.996 --> 00:08:35.964
Uh... I come to you for help,
and you insult me?!

175
00:08:35.966 --> 00:08:38.032
I thought the least that
you would do would be...

176
00:08:38.034 --> 00:08:40.034
Look, your anxiety levels
are right in the zone.

177
00:08:40.036 --> 00:08:41.369
Really?

178
00:08:41.371 --> 00:08:43.004
Oh, that's fantastic.

179
00:08:43.006 --> 00:08:44.272
N-Now, wait,
they're dropping.

180
00:08:44.274 --> 00:08:45.406
Why are they dropping?

181
00:08:45.408 --> 00:08:47.375
Because you're happy
they're elevated.

182
00:08:47.377 --> 00:08:49.177
Oh, that is infuriating!

183
00:08:49.179 --> 00:08:50.712
Ooh, look, they went
back up again.

184
00:08:50.714 --> 00:08:51.679
Terrific.

185
00:08:51.681 --> 00:08:53.481
Oh, no, they went
back down!

186
00:08:55.652 --> 00:08:59.654
All right, guys, what game
do you want to play?

187
00:08:59.656 --> 00:09:00.889
E'
Let's see.

188
00:09:00.891 --> 00:09:04.626
How about
âEmily or Cinnamonâ"

189
00:09:05.695 --> 00:09:07.562
You know what? I think
it's a little weird

190
00:09:07.564 --> 00:09:09.397
that you remember me
saying all these things.E'

191
00:09:09.399 --> 00:09:12.901
Maybe the truth is-- you're
jealous of all my relationships.

192
00:09:13.703 --> 00:09:15.737
Oh, maybe I am.

193
00:09:15.739 --> 00:09:17.438
Who wouldn't want
to be the girl,

194
00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.441
or possibly dog,
to hear the words:

195
00:09:20.443 --> 00:09:22.410
âYou're so lucky.

196
00:09:22.412 --> 00:09:24.512
You have the
shiniest hairâ.

197
00:09:28.018 --> 00:09:29.984
That is a tough one.

198
00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:32.220
Uh, I-I know he brushes
both of them.

199
00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:36.457
Gentlemen...
Yeah.

200
00:09:36.459 --> 00:09:39.627
I have figured out the perfect
way for you to irritate me.

201
00:09:39.629 --> 00:09:43.498
I'd like you to be my
intellectual sparring partners.

202
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.900
From now on,
when I make an assertion,

203
00:09:45.902 --> 00:09:47.335
I need you to challenge it.

204
00:09:47.337 --> 00:09:50.805
So you just want us to disagree
with whatever you say?

205
00:09:50.807 --> 00:09:51.973
Yes.

206
00:09:51.975 --> 00:09:54.842
And you think that's going to help?
Yes.

207
00:09:54.844 --> 00:09:57.445
Well, I don't think
that's gonna help at all.

208
00:09:57.447 --> 00:09:58.880
Oh, no, it will.

209
00:09:58.882 --> 00:10:02.383
See, by keeping my mind engaged,
I'll become more focused.

210
00:10:02.385 --> 00:10:04.786
Howard's right--
that'll never work.

211
00:10:04.788 --> 00:10:06.421
Stop fighting me on the premise.

212
00:10:06.423 --> 00:10:08.022
It's scientifically valid.

213
00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:09.624
I'm going to advance
propositions,

214
00:10:09.626 --> 00:10:11.192
I just want you to challenge me.

215
00:10:11.194 --> 00:10:14.062
I don't think that's
what you want at all.

216
00:10:15.131 --> 00:10:16.764
Why, of course it's what I want.

217
00:10:16.766 --> 00:10:19.300
Why would I say it's what I want
if it's not what I want?

218
00:10:19.302 --> 00:10:22.537
Because it is what you want,
and it's not what you said.

219
00:10:24.341 --> 00:10:27.041
I ask you for one simple thing,
and you can't even do it.

220
00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:28.610
Yes, we can.
Yeah, well, then do it.

221
00:10:28.612 --> 00:10:30.244
Nah.

222
00:10:31.114 --> 00:10:33.047
You guys are the worst.

223
00:10:35.285 --> 00:10:38.086
Thank you,
I think that was helpful.

224
00:10:46.814 --> 00:10:49.682
So, whichever rep has
the best sales for the quarter

225
00:10:49.684 --> 00:10:51.250
gets a trip for two to Hawaii.

226
00:10:51.252 --> 00:10:53.819
That would be so romantic
for you and Leonard.

227
00:10:53.821 --> 00:10:56.188
Yeah, clearly you haven't
seen him on the beach

228
00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:58.090
walking around
with his metal detector.

229
00:10:59.427 --> 00:11:00.726
If I were going to Hawaii,

230
00:11:00.728 --> 00:11:03.395
I'd spend all my time
at the Keck Observatory.

231
00:11:03.397 --> 00:11:05.064
Did you know that
the telescopes there have

232
00:11:05.066 --> 00:11:06.599
better resolution
than the Hubble?

233
00:11:06.601 --> 00:11:08.033
Really?

234
00:11:08.035 --> 00:11:10.102
Want to go to Hawaii?

235
00:11:11.072 --> 00:11:12.071
Ladies?

236
00:11:12.073 --> 00:11:13.806
Ladies...

237
00:11:13.808 --> 00:11:15.541
Ladies?

238
00:11:15.543 --> 00:11:17.076
Come in.

239
00:11:17.945 --> 00:11:19.445
Ladies.

240
00:11:19.447 --> 00:11:20.946
What's up?

241
00:11:20.948 --> 00:11:23.282
As you may know,
I've been experimenting

242
00:11:23.284 --> 00:11:25.017
with elevated anxiety levels,

243
00:11:25.019 --> 00:11:26.252
and I thought,

244
00:11:26.254 --> 00:11:28.220
what better way
to increase my discomfort

245
00:11:28.222 --> 00:11:29.922
than to subject myself
to an evening

246
00:11:29.924 --> 00:11:32.491
of tasteless
uncensored crotch talk?

247
00:11:35.129 --> 00:11:38.130
What exactly do you think
goes on here?

248
00:11:38.132 --> 00:11:39.732
Well...

249
00:11:39.734 --> 00:11:41.433
conversations that you wouldn't
be comfortable having

250
00:11:41.435 --> 00:11:43.068
in front of the opposite sex.

251
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:44.870
You know, who has
the best cervix.

252
00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:49.108
Which sanitary napkin
is all the rage right now.

253
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:52.645
Men's buttocks, and how you want
to pat and squeeze them.

254
00:11:54.282 --> 00:11:56.715
We were talking
about Penny's job.

255
00:11:56.717 --> 00:11:58.651
And how difficult it is to do

256
00:11:58.653 --> 00:12:00.719
when she's bloated,
cranky and crampy?

257
00:12:00.721 --> 00:12:02.821
Continue.

258
00:12:04.659 --> 00:12:06.592
Sheldon, we are just people.

259
00:12:06.594 --> 00:12:08.794
We talk about the same things
you guys talk about.

260
00:12:08.796 --> 00:12:11.563
You talk about
if werewolves can swim?

261
00:12:11.565 --> 00:12:13.232
See, Leonard says yes,

262
00:12:13.234 --> 00:12:15.935
but I say it depends on
if the human could swim

263
00:12:15.937 --> 00:12:16.902
before he was bitten.

264
00:12:16.904 --> 00:12:18.570
What do you think?

265
00:12:19.573 --> 00:12:22.441
Let's just talk
about our periods.

266
00:12:22.443 --> 00:12:24.043
No, hold on.

267
00:12:24.045 --> 00:12:27.046
All canines instinctively know
how to swim.

268
00:12:27.048 --> 00:12:29.748
Why wouldn't a werewolf have
the same abilities?

269
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:32.418
Well, they're not
a hundred percent wolf.

270
00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:35.187
They're a werewolf--
that's only part wolf.

271
00:12:35.189 --> 00:12:37.289
It's like comparing
apples to oranges.

272
00:12:37.291 --> 00:12:39.091
Thank you.

273
00:12:39.093 --> 00:12:41.794
Oh, and technically, it's apples
that turn into were-oranges

274
00:12:41.796 --> 00:12:43.495
when the moon is full.

275
00:12:44.598 --> 00:12:46.832
Hey, this is fun.

276
00:12:46.834 --> 00:12:48.934
We should do it sometime
when you aren't all PMS'ing.

277
00:12:48.936 --> 00:12:50.502
Bye.

278
00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:00.546
What is going on?

279
00:13:00.548 --> 00:13:01.814
Oh.

280
00:13:01.816 --> 00:13:04.483
Uh, I need to keep my anxiety
at the right level,

281
00:13:04.485 --> 00:13:08.253
so I'm using Darth Vader,
the Joker, and Godzilla's roar

282
00:13:08.255 --> 00:13:10.022
to keep me in that sweet spot.

283
00:13:12.093 --> 00:13:14.460
Uh, I tried including
Taylor Swift in the mix,

284
00:13:14.462 --> 00:13:16.662
but turns out I love her.

285
00:13:18.966 --> 00:13:21.667
Well, at least listen to it
through headphones.

286
00:13:21.669 --> 00:13:23.669
I'm trying to sleep.
Good night.

287
00:13:24.505 --> 00:13:26.205
Boy!

288
00:13:27.475 --> 00:13:30.709
Taylor was right-- haters gonna
hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.

289
00:13:33.914 --> 00:13:36.548
You've been working
so much lately,

290
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:38.617
I'm glad you didn't forget
about date night.

291
00:13:38.619 --> 00:13:40.152
Of course.

292
00:13:42.423 --> 00:13:43.423
Sheldon.

293
00:13:43.424 --> 00:13:44.990
Yeah.

294
00:13:44.992 --> 00:13:47.893
Maybe you want to put the
notebook away and talk to me.

295
00:13:47.895 --> 00:13:49.928
I can do both.

296
00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:52.598
No, my brain is working
at optimal capacity.

297
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.633
No, I can have
a conversation with you

298
00:13:54.635 --> 00:13:58.771
and solve the dark matter proton
decay problem at the same time.

299
00:13:59.874 --> 00:14:01.240
Fine.
How was your day?

300
00:14:01.242 --> 00:14:02.741
Oh, you said it.

301
00:14:05.279 --> 00:14:06.578
Sheldon.

302
00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:08.247
Sheldon, I'm
worried about you.

303
00:14:08.249 --> 00:14:09.982
You're not eating,

304
00:14:09.984 --> 00:14:11.984
you haven't
slept in days,

305
00:14:11.986 --> 00:14:14.753
and, to be honest, that
cap is starting to smell.

306
00:14:15.956 --> 00:14:17.556
I know.

307
00:14:17.558 --> 00:14:20.259
It's replaced Godzilla as
my principle source of anxiety.

308
00:14:25.633 --> 00:14:27.933
Okay, so it's one vote Emily,
one vote Cinnamon.

309
00:14:27.935 --> 00:14:30.035
Penny, you're
the tiebreaker.

310
00:14:33.007 --> 00:14:34.473
Say the quote again.

311
00:14:34.475 --> 00:14:38.777
âIt's just so perfect
that we're both Libras.â

312
00:14:43.918 --> 00:14:46.218
Wow, this is hard.

313
00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:47.252
I'm gonna say
Cinnamon.

314
00:14:47.254 --> 00:14:49.354
Yes! Yes!
Come on!

315
00:14:50.691 --> 00:14:52.391
That was the last one,
I promise.

316
00:14:52.393 --> 00:14:53.625
We won't play anymore.

317
00:14:53.627 --> 00:14:55.060
Thank you.

318
00:14:55.062 --> 00:14:57.296
'Cause if she ever found out,
it would hurt her feelings.

319
00:14:57.298 --> 00:15:00.132
Emily's feelings?

320
00:15:00.134 --> 00:15:02.000
Yes, Emily.

321
00:15:02.002 --> 00:15:03.969
Nice! - Yay!
Good job!

322
00:15:05.706 --> 00:15:07.406
Whatever.
Where's Sheldon?

323
00:15:07.408 --> 00:15:08.640
Date night.

324
00:15:08.642 --> 00:15:10.342
Mmm, that can't be
much fun for Amy.

325
00:15:10.344 --> 00:15:12.845
You know, at work today,
he tried his first Red Bull.

326
00:15:12.847 --> 00:15:13.879
What happened?

327
00:15:13.881 --> 00:15:15.214
He chased a squirrel

328
00:15:15.216 --> 00:15:17.216
around the quad
for a while and...

329
00:15:18.185 --> 00:15:20.352
...then threw up in my car.

330
00:15:22.089 --> 00:15:24.490
Don't you think you should
make him stop all this?

331
00:15:24.492 --> 00:15:26.925
I don't know-- he's not
really hurting anybody.

332
00:15:26.927 --> 00:15:30.996
You didn't have to scoop vomit
out of your glove compartment.

333
00:15:30.998 --> 00:15:32.764
He is getting
a lot of work done.

334
00:15:32.766 --> 00:15:35.501
He had a pretty interesting
take on proton decay.

335
00:15:35.503 --> 00:15:39.171
Wow, if he cracks that,
it's a game changer, guys.

336
00:15:39.173 --> 00:15:41.206
It'll completely redefine
our understanding

337
00:15:41.208 --> 00:15:42.875
of the physical universe.

338
00:15:44.044 --> 00:15:46.612
Hmm, it would.

339
00:15:46.614 --> 00:15:49.181
Okay, back to
âEmily or Cinnamonâ"

340
00:15:50.451 --> 00:15:55.120
âHow can such a little girl
eat such a big steakâ"

341
00:15:59.693 --> 00:16:00.826
Sheldon,

342
00:16:00.828 --> 00:16:02.661
I want you to take
that cap off.

343
00:16:02.663 --> 00:16:06.698
That nagging tone is
helping my anxiety, yeah.

344
00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:09.034
But if you could maybe just go
ten percent less shrill,

345
00:16:09.036 --> 00:16:11.670
that'd really put the zip-a-Dee
in my doo-dah.

346
00:16:11.672 --> 00:16:14.206
I'm sorry, but
you know we agreed

347
00:16:14.208 --> 00:16:15.941
not to bring work
to date night.

348
00:16:15.943 --> 00:16:18.377
There you go, perfect.

349
00:16:18.379 --> 00:16:20.345
Sheldon, stop it,
I'm not kidding.

350
00:16:20.347 --> 00:16:23.182
Take the cap off, and
put the notebook away.

351
00:16:23.184 --> 00:16:26.885
But after months of struggling,
I'm finally making progress.

352
00:16:26.887 --> 00:16:29.788
You don't need to drive yourself
crazy in order to be productive.

353
00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:31.723
Or do I, hmm?

354
00:16:31.725 --> 00:16:34.092
Sir Isaac Newton wrote
his<i> Principia</i>

355
00:16:34.094 --> 00:16:36.728
while convinced he was
an armadillo.

356
00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:38.096
That's not true.

357
00:16:38.098 --> 00:16:39.765
Yeah, well, maybe it is,
maybe it isn't.

358
00:16:39.767 --> 00:16:41.633
I have been
hallucinating lately.

359
00:16:43.971 --> 00:16:45.571
Sheldon, this has to stop.

360
00:16:45.573 --> 00:16:48.106
You need to get some sleep
and take care of yourself.

361
00:16:48.108 --> 00:16:50.943
Amy, I have gotten more done
in the last few days

362
00:16:50.945 --> 00:16:53.278
than I have since I made
the switch to dark matter.

363
00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:56.648
What if I stop doing this,
and it all goes away?

364
00:16:56.650 --> 00:17:00.385
Your thoughts and ideas come
from you, not from your anxiety.

365
00:17:00.387 --> 00:17:01.653
Hmm, perhaps.

366
00:17:01.655 --> 00:17:03.322
But I'm not taking
the cap off.

367
00:17:04.258 --> 00:17:06.258
It's one thing to make
yourself miserable,

368
00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.627
but you're making everyone
around you miserable, too.

369
00:17:08.629 --> 00:17:12.331
Now, I'm telling you for the
last time-- take the cap off.

370
00:17:12.333 --> 00:17:13.966
Oh!

371
00:17:13.968 --> 00:17:15.300
Really?

372
00:17:15.302 --> 00:17:16.935
What if I don't?

373
00:17:16.937 --> 00:17:20.305
And before you answer that,
can I have my dessert?

374
00:17:21.742 --> 00:17:23.976
And then she
threw me out.

375
00:17:26.747 --> 00:17:29.014
Me, her very
own boyfriend.

376
00:17:29.016 --> 00:17:31.717
When all I've done is try
to help humanity reach

377
00:17:31.719 --> 00:17:34.920
a more profound understanding
of the world we live in.

378
00:17:38.092 --> 00:17:39.424
Yeah, well, women--

379
00:17:39.426 --> 00:17:41.293
what are you gonna do?

380
00:17:44.031 --> 00:17:46.565
I knew you'd understand,
Armadillo Isaac Newton.

381
00:17:51.005 --> 00:17:53.672
Okay...

382
00:17:53.674 --> 00:17:56.008
Here we are.

383
00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:57.976
Hey.

384
00:17:57.978 --> 00:17:59.811
What are you trying to pull?

385
00:17:59.813 --> 00:18:03.148
The president of
science isn't in here.

386
00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:06.051
You lie down, he'll be here
in a minute.

387
00:18:07.554 --> 00:18:08.987
Okay.

388
00:18:08.989 --> 00:18:11.156
Hey, I thought you were
trying to trick me.

389
00:18:14.228 --> 00:18:15.894
Now, you just
get comfortable.

390
00:18:15.896 --> 00:18:18.563
No, no, comfort is the enemy.

391
00:18:18.565 --> 00:18:19.865
You know what's comfortable?

392
00:18:19.867 --> 00:18:23.602
Slippers and blankets
and panda bears.

393
00:18:24.838 --> 00:18:29.007
Imagine a panda bear with
Richard Feynman's face on it.

394
00:18:30.344 --> 00:18:33.512
Warm up the car, Leonard,
it's poster time.

395
00:18:33.514 --> 00:18:35.147
Maybe in the morning.

396
00:18:35.149 --> 00:18:36.581
Yeah, you get
some sleep.

397
00:18:36.583 --> 00:18:39.051
No, I don't want to go
to sleep-- you can't make me.

398
00:18:39.053 --> 00:18:40.519
You're right, we can't.

399
00:18:40.521 --> 00:18:41.787
Yeah, darn straight, you can't.

400
00:18:41.789 --> 00:18:43.322
Try to tell a grown man
to go to sleep...

401
00:18:43.324 --> 00:18:46.024
âª Soft kitty âª

402
00:18:46.026 --> 00:18:48.193
âª Warm kitty âª

403
00:18:48.195 --> 00:18:50.696
âª Little ball of fur... âª

404
00:18:50.698 --> 00:18:53.031
That's not gonna work.

405
00:18:53.033 --> 00:18:56.668
âª Happy kitty,
sleepy kitty âª

406
00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:57.636
âª Purr âª

407
00:18:57.638 --> 00:19:00.706
âª Purr, purr. âª

408
00:19:03.277 --> 00:19:05.811
You know, he can be
a lot of trouble,

409
00:19:05.813 --> 00:19:08.847
but when I see him lying
here asleep like this,

410
00:19:08.849 --> 00:19:11.483
I just think...

411
00:19:11.485 --> 00:19:14.720
how easy it would be to
hold a pillow over his face.

412
00:19:23.235 --> 00:19:25.769
Wow, you look like
you got some rest.

413
00:19:25.771 --> 00:19:27.738
Oh, I'm feeling
much better.

414
00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:30.107
And I've also been
continuing to make progress

415
00:19:30.109 --> 00:19:32.943
without artificially
raising my anxiety levels.

416
00:19:32.945 --> 00:19:35.612
I turned on the heat in my car
and some vomit came out,

417
00:19:35.614 --> 00:19:36.981
so my levels--
right up there.

418
00:19:36.983 --> 00:19:38.949
Hey, guys.

419
00:19:38.951 --> 00:19:40.351
Mind if Emily
joins us for lunch?

420
00:19:40.353 --> 00:19:41.652
Yeah, sure. Yeah, no problem.
Of course not.

421
00:19:41.654 --> 00:19:44.588
So I hear you guys have been
playing a little game.

422
00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:47.825
Well, um, we were
just kidding around.

423
00:19:47.827 --> 00:19:50.527
Well, you may think it's funny
that Raj is sweet and sensitive,

424
00:19:50.529 --> 00:19:52.696
but I think it's sexy.

425
00:19:56.234 --> 00:19:58.569
Ugh, why is there dog hair
in your mouth?

426
