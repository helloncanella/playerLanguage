00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:38.118
Right.

But if you make your clients
money at the same time,

198
00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:42.269
it's advantageous to everyone.
Correct?

199
00:09:42.874 --> 00:09:44.066
No.

and it now sits at 16,
he's all fucking happy.

He wants to cash in, liquidate,

220
00:10:28.128 --> 00:10:29.878
take his fucking
money and run home.

221
00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:31.902
- You don't let him do that.
- Okay.

A special idea.

226
00:10:38.763 --> 00:10:41.265
Another "situation." Another stock

227
00:10:41.266 --> 00:10:43.392
to reinvest his
earnings and then some.

228
00:10:43.393 --> 00:10:45.712

'Cause they're fucking addicted.

230

And you just keep doing this,
again and again and again.

Meanwhile, he thinks
he's getting shit rich,

are you doing today?</i>

471
00:19:48.979 --> 00:19:51.606
You mailed in my company a
postcard a few weeks back

472
00:19:51.607 --> 00:19:53.400
requesting information
on Penny stocks

473
00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:55.527
that had huge upside potential

474
00:19:55.528 --> 00:19:57.278
with very little downside risk.

475
00:19:57.279 --> 00:19:59.280
- Does that ring a bell?
- <i>Yeah, I may have sent something.</i>

476
00:19:59.281 --> 00:20:02.492
Okay, great. The reason for
the call today, John, is,

477
00:20:02.493 --> 00:20:05.221
something just came
across my desk, John.

478
00:20:05.246 --> 00:20:06.621
It is perhaps the best thing

479
00:20:06.622 --> 00:20:08.123
I've seen in the last six months.

480
00:20:08.124 --> 00:20:09.999
If you have 60 seconds,
I'd like to share

481
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.292
the idea with you.
You got a minute?

482
00:20:11.293 --> 00:20:12.419
<i>Actually, I'm really very...</i>

483
00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.963
The name of the company,
Aerotyne International.

484
00:20:14.964 --> 00:20:18.318
It is a cutting edge high-tech
firm out of the Midwest

485
00:20:18.467 --> 00:20:20.385
<i>awaiting imminent
patent approval</i>

486
00:20:20.386 --> 00:20:22.971
on the next generation
of radar detectors

487
00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:27.578
that have both huge military
and civilian applications now.

488
00:20:27.601 --> 00:20:28.977
Right now, John,

489
00:20:28.978 --> 00:20:31.438
the stock trades over-the-counter
at 10 cents a share.

490
00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:33.815
And by the way, John,
our analysts indicate

491
00:20:33.816 --> 00:20:36.192
it could go a heck of a
lot higher than that.

492
00:20:36.193 --> 00:20:39.237
Your profit on a mere
$6,000 investment

493
00:20:39.238 --> 00:20:42.262
would be upwards of $60,000!

494
00:20:42.366 --> 00:20:43.867
<i>Jesus! That's my
mortgage, man.</i>

495
00:20:43.868 --> 00:20:45.535
Exactly. You could pay
off your mortgage.

496
00:20:45.536 --> 00:20:47.120
<i>This stock will
pay off my house?</i>

497
00:20:47.121 --> 00:20:48.997
John, one thing I can promise you,

498
00:20:48.998 --> 00:20:50.315
even in this market,

499
00:20:50.332 --> 00:20:52.125
is that I never ask my clients

500
00:20:52.126 --> 00:20:53.603
to judge me on my winners.

501
00:20:54.003 --> 00:20:57.573
I ask them to judge me on my
losers because I have so few.

502
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:59.215
And in the case of Aerotyne,

503
00:20:59.216 --> 00:21:01.926
based on every technical
factor out there, John,

504
00:21:01.927 --> 00:21:05.156
we are looking at a
grand slam home run.

505
00:21:05.389 --> 00:21:08.099
<i>Okay, let's do it.
I'll do 4 grand.</i>

506
00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.453
$4,000? That'd be
40,000 shares, John.

507
00:21:10.478 --> 00:21:11.936
Let me lock in that trade right now

with my secretary

- <i>Yeah, sounds good.</i>
- Great.

00:25:01.834 --> 00:25:04.061
No, they're not retarded
or anything like that.

619

But there's a big
chance, right, if...

620
00:25:06.046 --> 00:25:08.423
Yeah, there's like a 60%, you know,

621
00:25:08.424 --> 00:25:12.028
60 to 65% chance the kid's gonna
be fucking retarded or whatever.

That'd scare the shit
out of me, buddy.

623
00:25:13.262 --> 00:25:15.638

like that happened?

Basically, you know, if
the kid was retarded,

627
00:25:21.937 --> 00:25:25.356
I would, you know, drive
it up to the country

628
00:25:25.357 --> 00:25:27.108

open the door and say,

know, like, "Run free."

All right, tell me what
happened. What happened?

1081
00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:35.946
Well, he discovered it
was the mother's sister.

The main guy...

00:44:01.722 --> 00:44:03.056
I don't think he's gonna

You can't look him

You can't look him in the eye?

their wires get crossed.

1104

You gotta look at their Chin.

1105
00:44:14.819 --> 00:44:15.944
Like it looks like
I'm looking at you

1106
00:44:15.945 --> 00:44:17.028
but I'm looking at your Chin.

I feel like you're addressing me
right now, but you're not, are you?

1108
00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:21.241

like, wherever you are
standing in the room.

1110
00:44:22.952 --> 00:44:24.178

We're allowed to throw shit at 'em.

1113
00:44:28.082 --> 00:44:29.583
We're allowed to throw food?
Bananas.

1114
00:44:29.584 --> 00:44:31.084
Any food. Correct.

1115
00:44:31.085 --> 00:44:32.252
But, for example,
what I wouldn't do is

1116
00:44:32.253 --> 00:44:34.087
maybe like tell him
to pull his cock out

1117
00:44:34.088 --> 00:44:35.898
and like get some of the
girls to, you know,

1118
00:44:35.923 --> 00:44:37.048
fondle him and shit like that.

1119
00:44:37.049 --> 00:44:38.133
That would be...
That's unacceptable?

1120
00:44:38.134 --> 00:44:39.217
Let's keep that in our back pocket.

1121
00:44:39.218 --> 00:44:41.303
This guy is more about
throwing at the dartboard.

1122
00:44:41.304 --> 00:44:42.405
Correct. Yes, yes, yes.

1123
00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:43.847
The thing is, this
is their gift, okay.

1124
00:44:43.848 --> 00:44:45.974
They're built to be
thrown like a lawn dart.

1125
00:44:45.975 --> 00:44:47.267
They're top heavy like a lawn dart.

1126
00:44:47.268 --> 00:44:48.351
So they're built for accuracy.

1127
00:44:48.352 --> 00:44:50.413
Oh, my God. Can we
bowl with this guy?

1128
00:44:50.438 --> 00:44:51.563
That's his fucking brother, Rob.

1129
00:44:51.564 --> 00:44:52.981
His brother's the bowling ball.

1130
00:44:52.982 --> 00:44:54.774
The brother, you put
a skateboard on him,

1131
00:44:54.775 --> 00:44:56.109
you strap him to a skateboard,

1132
00:44:56.110 --> 00:44:57.611
you toss him down an
alley at some pins.

1133
00:44:57.612 --> 00:44:59.321
- No shit. That's interesting.
- Swear to fucking God.

1134
00:44:59.322 --> 00:45:01.406
- Can we get that guy?
- Yeah, we'll get that guy, too.

1135
00:45:01.407 --> 00:45:03.575
But it says here this guy
will show his cock. Yeah.

1136
00:45:03.576 --> 00:45:04.910
- Instead of growing up. Yeah.
- He will?

1137
00:45:04.911 --> 00:45:06.286
They are very ornery by the way,

1138
00:45:06.287 --> 00:45:07.787
so you gotta be very careful
with these little guys.

1139
00:45:07.788 --> 00:45:08.872
Safety first.

1140
00:45:08.873 --> 00:45:10.040
Safety is first, all right?

1141
00:45:10.041 --> 00:45:11.958
I want somebody with a
fucking tranquilizer gun

1142
00:45:11.959 --> 00:45:13.710
ready to knock this fucker out.

1143
00:45:13.711 --> 00:45:15.962
- Do we want to get like a...
- Mace. Taser guns.

1144
00:45:15.963 --> 00:45:17.047
A pellet gun maybe?

1145
00:45:17.048 --> 00:45:18.256
No, a pellet gun is gonna hurt him.

1146
00:45:18.257 --> 00:45:19.737
I just want him out.
Knocked out cold.

1147
00:45:19.759 --> 00:45:22.362
But I say we stick with the
loophole. Right? Okay?

1148
00:45:22.511 --> 00:45:24.304
If we don't consider him a human,

1149
00:45:24.305 --> 00:45:26.556
we just consider it an act,
I think we're in the clear.

1150
00:45:26.557 --> 00:45:27.682
Like The Flying Wallendas.

1151
00:45:27.683 --> 00:45:29.726
You know, a lot of those guys
died but they never sued anybody.

1152
00:45:29.727 --> 00:45:31.561
The important thing you
guys gotta keep in mind

1153
00:45:31.562 --> 00:45:33.505
is that these things gossip.

1154
00:45:33.522 --> 00:45:35.148
They get together and they gossip.

1155
00:45:35.149 --> 00:45:36.650
- That's a good point.
- And the last thing

1156
00:45:36.651 --> 00:45:38.902
that we need is them getting
together and saying,

1157
00:45:38.903 --> 00:45:40.570
"Oh, they made fun of us."

1158

think of shit like that.

it goes beyond just

1996

01:31:36.658 --> 01:31:38.075
We're the new guy. We're the one

2260
01:31:38.076 --> 01:31:40.452
that's banging on Wall Street's
door. I mean, you should...

2261
01:31:40.453 --> 01:31:42.413
You should see what's going
on at the bigger firms.

2262
01:31:42.414 --> 01:31:44.057
I mean, I know all the information.

2263
01:31:44.082 --> 01:31:47.061
It's true! Goldman, Lehman
Brothers, Merrill...

2264
01:31:47.252 --> 01:31:49.070
Collateralized debt obligations?

2265
01:31:49.087 --> 01:31:50.421
This Internet stock bullshit?

2266
01:31:50.422 --> 01:31:52.297
I mean, it's a fucking travesty.

2267
01:31:52.298 --> 01:31:54.550
I could take you step-by-step

2268
01:31:54.551 --> 01:31:57.370
through what exactly is occurring.

2269
01:31:57.554 --> 01:31:59.280
All you have to do is ask.

2270
01:31:59.305 --> 01:32:00.740
I'm available.

2271
01:32:00.765 --> 01:32:02.433
- That's exactly what I wanted to hear.
- Mmm-hmm.

2272
01:32:02.434 --> 01:32:05.413
I don't see why a little
sitdown like this

2273
01:32:05.979 --> 01:32:07.604
can't be profitable
for the both of us.

2274
01:32:07.605 --> 01:32:09.940
It should. Right? It should
profit the both of us.

2275
01:32:09.941 --> 01:32:11.588
- It should.
- Look.

2276
01:32:12.027 --> 01:32:14.319
I'm gonna give you
my personal line.

2277
01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:17.344
Five days a week, you
just call me, feel free.

2278
01:32:17.449 --> 01:32:19.267
- I'll do that.
- Great.

2279
01:32:21.455 --> 01:32:23.495
Are you sure you guys don't
want something to drink?

2280
01:32:23.496 --> 01:32:25.247
You're not hungry? Nothing?

2281
01:32:25.248 --> 01:32:26.975
- Nothing? No?
- Oh, no.

2282
01:32:30.003 --> 01:32:31.128
Let me ask you,

2283
01:32:31.129 --> 01:32:32.629
and if you don't wanna
get too personal,

2284
01:32:32.630 --> 01:32:34.903
- just tell me to shut up at any time.
- Oh.

2285
01:32:35.842 --> 01:32:38.552
Did you try to get your
broker's license at one time?

2286
01:32:38.553 --> 01:32:41.497
Did I hear that right? Were you
trying to take a stab at Wall Street?

2287
01:32:42.307 --> 01:32:44.308
- No? <font color="#808080">(CHUCKLES)</font>
- Who you been talking to?

2288
01:32:44.309 --> 01:32:45.392
Who the fuck you been talking to?

2289
01:32:45.393 --> 01:32:46.518
Well, you're investigating me.

2290
01:32:46.519 --> 01:32:48.062
- I hear things.

2292
01:32:50.386 --> 01:32:52.066
You ever think about
what would've happened

2293
01:32:52.067 --> 01:32:54.761
if you would have
stayed the course?

2294
01:32:55.901 --> 01:32:57.821
You know what? When I'm
riding home on the subway

2295
01:32:57.822 --> 01:32:59.198
and my balls are fucking sweating,

2296
01:32:59.199 --> 01:33:01.075
I'm wearing the same suit
three days in a row...

2297
01:33:01.076 --> 01:33:02.659
Yeah, you bet I do.

2298
01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:04.495
I've thought about it before.
Who wouldn't, right?

2299
01:33:04.496 --> 01:33:05.621
Right, who fucking wouldn't?

2300
01:33:05.622 --> 01:33:06.789
What do you get...

2301
01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:08.123
Another personal question,
no need to answer...

2302
01:33:08.124 --> 01:33:09.583
No, that's all right, Jordan.

2303
01:33:09.584 --> 01:33:12.733
What do you pull in? 50, 60K?
Something like that?

2304
01:33:12.754 --> 01:33:14.838
- A year? In the ballpark?
- Oh.

2305
01:33:14.839 --> 01:33:16.381
Well, I...

2306
01:33:16.382 --> 01:33:18.258
Let's put it this way.

2307
01:33:18.259 --> 01:33:19.551
You get a free handgun

2308
01:33:19.552 --> 01:33:21.432
- when you sign up for the Bureau.
- <font color="#808080">(CHUCKLING)</font>

2309
01:33:21.721 --> 01:33:24.014
No, but it fucking pisses me
off. You know what I mean?

2310
01:33:24.015 --> 01:33:26.266
You think about the people
that built this country,

2311
01:33:26.267 --> 01:33:27.768
hardworking people like you.

2312
01:33:27.769 --> 01:33:30.418
Firefighters, teachers, FBI agents.

2313
01:33:30.438 --> 01:33:34.191
End of the day, you guys get
fucking skinned alive financially.

2314
01:33:34.192 --> 01:33:36.151
It fucking makes me angry.

2315
01:33:36.152 --> 01:33:39.301
Now the one thing about Wall
Street and this market is,

2316
01:33:39.322 --> 01:33:41.095
for me, I feel

2317
01:33:42.033 --> 01:33:44.493
it's good to give back.
You know, there's...

2318
01:33:44.494 --> 01:33:46.745
There are situations where I can

2319
01:33:46.746 --> 01:33:50.374
make those situations better
for people. You know?

2320
01:33:50.375 --> 01:33:51.750
You know what I mean.

2321
01:33:51.751 --> 01:33:53.273
Opportunity

2322
01:33:53.711 --> 01:33:54.795
is everything.

2323
01:33:54.796 --> 01:33:56.148
Exactly.

2324
01:33:56.172 --> 01:33:58.715
Take for example, I got
this one kid, right?

2325
01:33:58.716 --> 01:34:02.553
Went to school for environmental
science, something like that.

2326
01:34:02.554 --> 01:34:04.471
He was bogged down
by student loans.

2327
01:34:04.472 --> 01:34:06.974
Turns out, his mother needed
triple bypass surgery.

2328
01:34:06.975 --> 01:34:08.725
- Jesus.
- Right. Horrible situation.

2329
01:34:08.726 --> 01:34:09.810
Sure.

2330
01:34:09.811 --> 01:34:10.978
But we got him into the market

2331
01:34:10.979 --> 01:34:12.729
at the right time and
chose the right stock.

2332
01:34:12.730 --> 01:34:14.565
We gave him the right guidance.

2333
01:34:14.566 --> 01:34:17.340
Boom! Overnight, changed
his entire life.

2334
01:34:17.902 --> 01:34:19.486
Got to put his mother into

2335
01:34:19.487 --> 01:34:21.321
the best hospital in New York City.

2336
01:34:21.322 --> 01:34:22.489
It didn't work out for her,

2337
01:34:22.490 --> 01:34:24.283
granted, she passed
away, unfortunately.

2338
01:34:24.284 --> 01:34:26.243
But we gave him that opportunity.

2339
01:34:26.244 --> 01:34:27.516
You know what I'm saying?

2340
01:34:28.163 --> 01:34:29.913
It's just about setting
up the right team,

2341
01:34:29.914 --> 01:34:32.767
and then overnight
your life can change.

2342
01:34:38.047 --> 01:34:40.570
What does... What does an intern...

2343
01:34:42.010 --> 01:34:43.927
What does an intern make
in a deal like that?

2344
01:34:43.928 --> 01:34:46.076
Well, in that situation,

2345
01:34:46.931 --> 01:34:50.080
in that particular trade,
and it was one trade,

2346
01:34:50.268 --> 01:34:52.917
north of half a million dollars.

2347
01:34:56.441 --> 01:34:58.775
And I'd do that for
anybody, you know,

2348
01:34:58.776 --> 01:35:01.550
anybody that needs
the proper guidance.

2349
01:35:21.257 --> 01:35:23.359
Can you say that again,

2350
01:35:23.718 --> 01:35:25.286
just the way you said it?

2351
01:35:25.762 --> 01:35:27.580
Just the same way.

2352
01:35:29.265 --> 01:35:30.457
Oh.

2353
01:35:31.289 --> 01:35:32.809
I don't know what
you're talking about.

2354
01:35:32.810 --> 01:35:34.753
Oh, come on! You know
what I'm talking about.

2355
01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:37.253
I think what Jordan
just did is he...

2356
01:35:37.273 --> 01:35:38.482
- If I'm not mistaken...
- No.

2357
01:35:38.483 --> 01:35:40.692
You just tried to bribe
a federal officer.

2358
01:35:40.693 --> 01:35:42.861
No, technically I
didn't bribe anybody.

2359
01:35:42.862 --> 01:35:45.364
No, no, that's not the
conversation I heard, Jordan.

2360
01:35:45.365 --> 01:35:46.949
No, no, according to the U.S.
criminal code,

2361
01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:48.867
there needs to be an
exact dollar figure

2362
01:35:48.868 --> 01:35:50.452
- for the exchange of services.
- Oh!

2363
01:35:50.453 --> 01:35:52.162
That would not hold
up in a court of law.

2364
01:35:52.163 --> 01:35:53.914
Nah, it's not howl heard it.

2365
01:35:53.915 --> 01:35:56.667
No, no, no, that's the truth.
But I want to tell you this.

2366
01:35:56.668 --> 01:35:57.793
Yeah.

2367
01:35:57.794 --> 01:35:59.378
The same gentleman that told me

2368
01:35:59.379 --> 01:36:01.213
that you tried to get
your broker's license

2369
01:36:01.214 --> 01:36:03.442
also told me that you
are a straight arrow.

2370
01:36:03.466 --> 01:36:05.008
He ran a security check on me.

2371
01:36:05.009 --> 01:36:06.235
Well...

2372
01:36:06.344 --> 01:36:09.388
Yeah, when you sail on a
boat fit for a Bond villain,

2373
01:36:09.389 --> 01:36:11.617
sometimes you need to
play the part. Right?

2374
01:36:12.811 --> 01:36:14.851
I think it's time you both
get the fuck off my boat.

tell you something.

Most of the Wall Street

they're to the manor born.

- Yeah.

The Kimmie that I met didn't have
two nickels to rub together.

She was a single mom on

Okay? She was three months
behind on her rent.

3234
02:13:13.068 --> 02:13:16.863
And when she came to me
and asked me for a job,

3235
02:13:16.864 --> 02:13:19.115
she asked for a $5,000 advance

just so she could pay
her son's tuition.

02:34:38.186 --> 02:34:39.269
Oh, you wanna go inside

3760
02:34:39.270 --> 02:34:40.771
and blow some lines
of baking powder?

3761
02:34:40.772 --> 02:34:42.689
- Or baking soda...
- <font color="#808080">(CHUCKLING)</font>

3762
02:34:42.690 --> 02:34:45.066
Can't imagine ever not
enjoying getting fucked up.

3763
02:34:45.067 --> 02:34:46.610
- Yeah.
- I love it.

3764
02:34:46.611 --> 02:34:48.195
How's being sober?

3765
02:34:48.196 --> 02:34:50.155
- Fucking sucks.
- Boring, right?

3766
02:34:50.156 --> 02:34:52.634
So boring. I wanna kill myself.

3767
02:34:53.075 --> 02:34:55.702
There's a term, and we
don't like to use it

3768
02:34:55.703 --> 02:34:57.245
unless circumstances dictate,

3769
02:34:57.246 --> 02:34:59.331
and I think they do
dictate in this case,

3770
02:34:59.332 --> 02:35:00.832
and the term is "Grenada."

3771
02:35:00.833 --> 02:35:02.417
Have you ever heard of Grenada?

3772
02:35:02.418 --> 02:35:03.585
No. No, I haven't.

3773
02:35:03.586 --> 02:35:05.212
Grenada's very interesting because

3774
02:35:05.213 --> 02:35:07.214
it is a small island nation

3775
02:35:07.215 --> 02:35:10.842
that was invaded by the United
States of America in 1983.

3776
02:35:10.843 --> 02:35:13.011
It's about 90,000 people.

3777
02:35:13.012 --> 02:35:15.331
And essentially, it means

3778
02:35:16.015 --> 02:35:18.058
this case is unloseable.

3779
02:35:18.059 --> 02:35:19.226
Okay?

3780
02:35:19.227 --> 02:35:20.894
So, you know, we can come in,

3781
02:35:20.895 --> 02:35:22.854
we can have our dick
hanging out of our pants.

3782
02:35:22.855 --> 02:35:24.064
Nobody gives a fuck.

3783
02:35:24.065 --> 02:35:25.792
I'm gonna win.

3784
02:35:25.817 --> 02:35:27.294
You, Sir.

3785
02:35:28.736 --> 02:35:30.554
Are what's known

3786
02:35:31.489 --> 02:35:32.739
as a Grenada.

3787
02:35:32.740 --> 02:35:33.932
<font color="#804040">JORDAN</font>: Hmm.

3788
02:35:35.785 --> 02:35:38.245
You're looking at real prison time.

02:35:38.246 --> 02:35:39.329
Hmm.

3790
02:35:39.330 --> 02:35:41.728
Money laundering can get
you as much as 20 years.

3791
02:35:42.625 --> 02:35:45.418
And our case couldn't be
stronger if we caught you

3792
02:35:45.419 --> 02:35:47.170
shoving cash in your mattress.

3793
02:35:47.171 --> 02:35:48.318
<font color="#804040">JORDAN</font>: Is that right?

3795

Your rotting away in jail till
your kids get out of college,

3796
02:35:56.097 --> 02:35:57.870
that's not our ambition here.

3797
02:35:59.141 --> 02:36:01.768
There's other people
involved in this, too.

3798
02:36:01.769 --> 02:36:05.043
We think they need to see
their day in court as well.

3799
02:36:07.525 --> 02:36:09.609
Why do I sense there's
an offer in the air?

3800
02:36:09.610 --> 02:36:12.384
Look at him. He's got a sense.
What are you, Kreskin?

3801
02:36:13.489 --> 02:36:16.366
Full cooperation. He provides
us with a comprehensive list

3802
02:36:16.367 --> 02:36:18.785
of all the co-conspirators
spanning the last seven years,

3803
02:36:18.786 --> 02:36:20.871
and he also agrees to wear a wire.

3804
02:36:20.872 --> 02:36:22.205
<font color="#808080">(CHUCKLING)</font>
Wait...

3805
02:36:22.206 --> 02:36:24.040
Did you just say "wear a wire"?

3806
02:36:24.041 --> 02:36:25.375
A wire. Mmm-hmm.

3807
02:36:25.376 --> 02:36:26.793
What does that mean?

3808
02:36:26.794 --> 02:36:28.753
You want me to rat? Is that it?

3809
02:36:28.754 --> 02:36:30.130
No, I want you to cooperate.

3810
02:36:30.131 --> 02:36:32.132
- No. You want me to rat, right?
- Yes. We want you to rat.

3811
02:36:32.133 --> 02:36:35.658
That's fucking exactly what
we want you to do. To rat.

3815
02:36:45.646 --> 02:36:48.189
Babe, I spoke to the
lawyers again today.

3816
02:36:48.190 --> 02:36:50.942
I have some really,
really great news.

3817
02:36:50.943 --> 02:36:52.386
Mmm-hmm.

3818
02:36:52.695 --> 02:36:55.389
Turns out you're completely
off the hook, honey.

3819
02:36:56.240 --> 02:36:57.991
I know that already.

3820
02:36:57.992 --> 02:36:59.389
Right. Exactly.

3821
02:36:59.702 --> 02:37:03.022
You never did anything wrong
in the first place, right?

3822
02:37:03.748 --> 02:37:06.067
It turns out, all the FBI really

3823
02:37:06.626 --> 02:37:08.603
wants from me is to, uh,

3824
02:37:08.794 --> 02:37:10.396
to cooperate.

3825
02:37:10.504 --> 02:37:11.838
You know?

3826
02:37:11.839 --> 02:37:13.214
Turns out I have so
much information

3827
02:37:13.215 --> 02:37:14.883
about the stock market
and Wall Street,

3828
02:37:14.884 --> 02:37:16.092
I could save the government

3829
02:37:16.093 --> 02:37:18.094
years of heartache, not to mention

3830
02:37:18.095 --> 02:37:20.573
- countless dollars.
- Mmm-hmm.

3831
02:37:20.890 --> 02:37:23.334
But it gets even better, babe.

3832
02:37:23.684 --> 02:37:26.333
Because if I do
decide to cooperate,

3833
02:37:26.646 --> 02:37:29.522
I might only be looking
at four short years,

3834
02:37:29.523 --> 02:37:31.107
in which case, you know,

3835
02:37:31.108 --> 02:37:34.194
we could start fresh,
maybe sell the house.

3836
02:37:34.195 --> 02:37:35.946
And any fines that I'd have to pay

3837
02:37:35.947 --> 02:37:37.822
wouldn't be due till
after I serve my term,

3838
02:37:37.823 --> 02:37:40.200
so we'd still have plenty of
money left over, you know?

3839
02:37:40.201 --> 02:37:41.723
Mmm-hmm.

3840
02:37:42.745 --> 02:37:45.246
The only thing that of course
bummed me out a little bit

3841
02:37:45.247 --> 02:37:47.600
is this whole idea of having to

3842
02:37:48.125 --> 02:37:50.377
give information about my friends.

3843
02:37:50.378 --> 02:37:53.713
Like you said, "There's no
friends on Wall Street." Right?

3844
02:37:53.714 --> 02:37:55.715
Right. Right. Exactly.

3845
02:37:55.716 --> 02:37:57.384
There's a silver lining
to that, too, honey.

3846
02:37:57.385 --> 02:37:59.177
Because they said eventually...

3847
02:37:59.178 --> 02:38:02.138
Eventually everyone's gonna have
to give information on this case.

3848
02:38:02.139 --> 02:38:05.016
So, at the end of the day, it might
not even be a factor. You know?

3849
02:38:05.017 --> 02:38:07.227
Well, that's good news. Right?

3850
02:38:07.228 --> 02:38:09.062
Yeah, yeah.

3851
02:38:09.063 --> 02:38:10.836
I'm really happy for you.

3852
02:38:12.149 --> 02:38:15.503
What do you mean, happy
for me, sweetheart?

3853
02:38:16.320 --> 02:38:18.989
You should be happy for
the both of us. Right?

3854
02:38:18.990 --> 02:38:21.013
- Yeah, right.
- All right.
